# Other Magento on Docker Projects

There are lots of other projects using Docker outside of this repository.

* Docker Hub has over 30 images last time I searched (https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=magento&searchfield=).
* Alan Kent has some blog posts on Docker (http://alankent.wordpress.com/?s=docker&submit=Search), most of which are related to Magento.
* One of the more active Magento 1 Docker image guys (https://github.com/ilampirai/magentoone).
* DocHarris - Docker setup for Magento in use with 2xRedis, MySQL, Nginx, PHP 5.5 (later 5.6 and HHVM containers) (https://github.com/Zookal/DocHarris).
